The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed that 12 people were still missing mid-morning on Wednesday following a massive overnight fire aboard an offshore rig operating about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico.
A coast guard official said firefighters were still battling the blaze that broke out around 10 p.m. aboard the Deepwater Horizon.
The semi-submersible rig is owned and operated by Houston-based Transocean, the world's largest offshroe drilling contractor, and has been under lease by BP since 2007.
The U.S. Coast Guard said 15 workers had been transported by air ambulance early Wednesday morning and were being treated at West Jefferson Hospital in New Orleans and at the Mobile Trauma Center in Mobile, Ala.
A spokeswoman for West Jefferson Medical Center said four of the injured were taken there early this morning but three have been discharged.
Seven people in all were critically injured in the fire, the cause of which is still being investigated. Ninety-nine others who were safely evacuated from the rig are currently en route to Port Fourchon,the U.S. Coast Guard said.
In a recent fleet report, Transocean said Deepwater Horizon entered service in 2001 and can operate in 10,000 feet of water and drilling to a depth of 30,000 feet. The company has about 17 rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico.
